This program extracts information of confirmed cases of Covid-19 and total deaths only in US, starting from the date 22-Jan-2020
upto the latest updation on the GitHub repository from which it extracts the data, which is generally updated daily. Please be 
informed that in US the clear data about number of patients is not available so that isnt provided by this script.
        
Thanks for using my script. Consider giving my repo a star if this helps.

# How to use the script

1. Download the files 'dependency_installation.py' and 'master_data_US.py' and save them together in a folder.
2. If you have 'pandas' and 'numpy' installed, there is no need to run 'dependency_installation.py'. If you dont have them, then just select and run the file. If you dont understand what I am talking about then run it anyway.
3. Double click on 'master_data_US.py'. It should ask for the name of US state. Please enter the name exactly in the way mentioned below in the list.
4. Wait for 5-10 seconds (depends on the speed of your internet connection). A file 'data.csv' will appear right inside the folder containing latest data.
